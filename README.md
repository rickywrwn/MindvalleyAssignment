<h1>Mindvalley Assignment</h1>

Channel iOS App using MVVM and UIKit
<br>
This project is created using Xcode 16.0

<h1>What parts of the test did you find challenging and why</h1>
For me the most challenging part was unit testing because this is my first time to implement unit testing in project. 
<br>
Before this i only tried it in a simple function. So this is my first time using unit testing.

<h1>What feature would you like to add in the future to improve the project</h1>
<li>Researching about Combine and implement it to improve View Model and View interaction</li>
<li>Implement layout handler for landscape</li>
<li>Specific layout for all across ipad models</li>
<li>More Unit test coverage</li>

<h1>Attention</h1>
In build setting for all of the targets and Project
I need to change User Script Sanboxing to No so that i can run this project and unit test otherwise there will be errors about Sanbox: rsync samba.
<br>
If this project has errors about Sanbox: rsync samba in Xcode under 16, please try to change User Script Sanboxing to yes in project and all targets. Thank you
